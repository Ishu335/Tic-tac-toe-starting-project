# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Starting Project

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. It demonstrates how React components, state management, and props can be used to build an interactive game.

⚛️ React Components – Modular structure for the board, squares, and game logic.
🔄 State Management – Uses React hooks to handle turns, game status, and resets.
🏆 Win & Draw Detection – Highlights the winner or declares a tie.
🎨 Responsive UI – Styled for a smooth and clean user experience.
🚀 Beginner-Friendly – Great project to understand React basics like props, state, and conditional rendering.
